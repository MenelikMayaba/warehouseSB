1. **Inventory Management System**: I developed a comprehensive inventory module that includes real-time stock tracking, batch/serial number management, and automated low-stock alerts. My specific contribution involved designing the Item, Stock, and StockTransaction entities, implementing the ItemService and StockService with CRUD operations and transaction logging, and integrating Spring Data JPA for efficient database interactions. This mattered because it provides accurate, real-time visibility into warehouse stock levels, reducing errors and improving operational efficiency—though the system is still evolving with additional features like multi-location support.

2. **Role-Based User Management and Security**: I implemented a secure authentication system using Spring Security, including role-based access control for Admin, Picker, Packer, and other roles. My contribution included creating the User entity, UserService, and SecurityConfig with JWT-based authentication, along with custom exception handling for unauthorized access. This was crucial for protecting sensitive warehouse data and ensuring only authorized personnel can perform specific actions, enhancing overall system security—while ongoing work focuses on refining audit logging and user activity tracking.

3. **Picking and Packing Workflow Integration**: I built the picking and packing modules with controllers, services, and repositories for managing Pick, Packing, and DispatchInvoice entities, including barcode scanning support and order status updates. My role involved developing the PickingController and PackingController with REST endpoints, integrating with the inventory system for stock validation, and creating Thymeleaf templates for user dashboards. This streamlined the order fulfillment process, minimizing delays and improving accuracy in warehouse operations—though it's still in progress with optimizations for pick path algorithms and real-time notifications.
